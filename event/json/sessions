Key Takeaways</p><p>Here is a snapshot of a presentation I have given at conferences around the world but have tailored for this audience:</p><p>Artificial Intelligence allows us transform work and decision making in healthcare, transportation, retail, insurance, education and more. At IBM, we extract deep insights from both large and small data sets, structured and unstructured to empower smarter business.</p><p>Our Watson Assistant provides out-of-the box, pre-trained conversation in domain areas of banking, telecommunications, insurance and energy &amp; utilities. Watson Studio provides a tooling environment that allows developers and product managers to collaborate on projects. Watson Discovery is the world's most powerful insight engine which leverages the fullest spectrum of cognitive technologies to learn more less data. And these are only a few of our technologies. Taken altogether, our AI products unlock data because in this era of AI, long standing enterprises that have years of accumulated business and consumer knowledge will differentiate themselves with Watson and win.\u00a0</p><p>In this presentation, I want to walk you through how companies all over the world our leveraging our cognitive technologies to develop meaningful conversations with their teams and clients. Using Watson, companies like Centiment can identify 35 different emotions on any given topic; increasing their likelihood of reaching a desired outcome with customers by 50%. Or companies can train Watson like how H&amp;R Block trained Watson on the language of taxes and is now be used by over 70,000 tax professionals to understand content, interpret intent, and draw conclusions between a client's responses to suggest tax benefits. But this is only the beginning of Watson's power.</p><p>Woodside Energy used Watson to turn workers' stories into data. Watson analyzed millions of documents and put 30 years of practical engineer experience at the fingertips of Woodside employes. Watson then finds, exposes and organizes this information helping safety analysts find workplace safety improvements so that together, Woodside and IBM can make a difference to people\u2019s lives.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p style=\"\"></p>\n\n<p></p>", "speakers": [{"short_biography": "<p><span style=\"\">Angel is the former CEO &amp; Founder of Leaders Working, an EdTech company acquired by Bloomberg.</span><span style=\"\">Following Leaders Working's acquisition, Angel worked in Venture Capital, investing and scaling SaaS, NextGen commerce, and AI companies before heading west to build and take to market products in analytics at Facebook and Google.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">Today, Angel works at IBM Watson where he leverages AI technology to develop products that will deliver empathy at scale.</span></p>", "photo": "https://storage.googleapis.com/eventyay.com/events/324/speakers/3606/photo/aTllUUVjTk/0a117dd5-29db-4d50-bd3c-51d4e168f208.png", "sponsorship_required": "", "id": 3606, "icon": "https://storage.googleapis.com/eventyay.com/events/324/speakers/3606/icon/aDdTUXVzMk/4a40115a-02cb-4cae-83f4-fa900fad49ab.jpg", "city": null, "name": "Angel Montesdeoca", "speaking_experience": "", "organisation": "IBM", "long_biography": "", "heard_from": null, "small": "https://storage.googleapis.com/eventyay.com/events/324/speakers/3606/small/S1FNZThTdn/6ed51192-2053-4071-bd07-f304144ebb00.jpg", "thumbnail": "https://storage.googleapis.com/eventyay.com/events/324/speakers/3606/thumbnail/V1RhZEtjak/957ab973-3cdf-4475-9c94-353d88c9cde8.jpg"}], "subtitle": "", "language": "", "title": "How AI Can Help Businesses Have More Meaningful Conversations With Us", "track": {"color": "#73decb", "font_color": "#000000", "id": 919, "name": "Machine Learning, Algorithms and Artificial Intelligence"}, "start_time": "2018-12-01T13:40:00+08:00", "level": "", "comments": "<p>This talk can be in either a speaker long presentation (~20 mins) or lighting talk (~5mins).
